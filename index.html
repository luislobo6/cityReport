        <h2>Why is it important to meassure the temperature of the world?</h2>
        <p><em>City's Temperature(F) by Latitude</em></p>
        <p>Temperature is important because it is something we feel. We have to adjust our housing and clothing to it if we live in different places or at different times of year. If we get too cold or too hot we cannot survive. But heat from the sun also evaporates water from the ground and drives the water cycle.</p>

        <p><em>City's Cloudiness by Latitude</em></p>
        <p>Clouds can block light and heat from the Sun, making Earth's temperature cooler. You've probably noticed this kind of cooldown on a cloudy day. However, some heat from the Sun does get down to Earth. Clouds can trap that heat from the Sun.</p>

        <p><em>City's Humidity by Latitude</em></p>
        <p>Humidity has an important influence on our atmosphere, affecting water vapour and rainfall. First, let us talk about the effects it has on human and animal health.</p>

        <p><em>City's Wind Speed by Latitude</em></p>
        <p>Wind speed and direction are important for monitoring and predicting weather patterns and global climate. Wind speed and direction have numerous impacts on surface water. These parameters affect rates of evaporation, mixing of surface waters, and the development of seiches and storm surges.</p>
